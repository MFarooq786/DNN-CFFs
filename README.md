I created a branch named "Farooq," and repository DNN-CFFs is forked from the UVA-spin/DNN-CFFs. It contains the directories Baseline and Work. The directory (Farooq) was created by Farooq. 
The directory Farooq contains the code used to train, test, and validate the given data for CFFs. It contains the source code, .csv file, and bash scripts applicable to run the source code on your local machine and push the updates on your GitHub repository in real-time. 
Please see the description of the shell script files in the directory "Farooq."
